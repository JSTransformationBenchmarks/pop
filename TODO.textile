h3. Features

* nib (to make it easier to share styles?)
* Mock filesystem for tests so I don't need to write to /tmp
* Shared logging so I can turn it off during tests
* Make template language configurable, default to jade
* If enough people get confused about manually installing Express, I'll make it a dependency for the optional dev server mode
* Autogenerate new files, generate index pages when posts change
* Make it possible to generate sites with relative URLs fairly easily (I want to generate things for directories on dropbox)
