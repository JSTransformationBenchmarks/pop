h3. Features

* Make it accept a command line param for a single file to generate, with an option to watch for changes (i.e., regenerate latest post + index.jade)
* Make prettyprint css built in? Alternate pretty print tags? (I use the liquid tags because all the DailyJS posts use that)
* rss helper
* nib (to make it easier to share styles?)
* Mock filesystem for tests so I don't need to write to /tmp
* Shared logging so I can turn it off during tests
* Make template language configurable, default to jade
* If enough people get confused about manually installing Express, I'll make it a dependency for the optional dev server mode
* Autogenerate new files, generate index pages when posts change
